### **BUSINESS INTRODUCTION**
Frontier Mart is a prominent retail company offering a wide variety of products across multiple categories, including household items, electronics, clothing, and groceries.

### **RECOMMENDATIONS**

Scale Inventory for Best-Selling Products : Since products like Sparkle Dish Gel and KidSteps Sneakers generated the highest sales and profits, prioritize inventory and marketing for these items to maximize returns.

Strengthen December Marketing Campaigns : December had the highest sales volume. Capitalize on this by launching seasonal promotions, bundling offers, and loyalty programs ahead of the holiday peak.

Promote the Household & Cleaning Category : With $2.3M in sales, this was the top-performing category. Focus promotional efforts here, while also identifying underperforming categories for repositioning.

Encourage Online Payments & Wholesaler Sales : Since Online payments account for 51.7% of transactions and Wholesalers bring in the most revenue, improve payment convenience and strengthen B2B partnerships.

Monitor Low-Performing Months : Months like May and February showed lower sales. Investigate causes (e.g., seasonality, stock issues) and introduce targeted promotions or product launches during these periods.

Leverage Data for Demand Forecasting : Use monthly trends and product performance to create accurate demand forecasts—minimizing overstock or stockouts and improving supply chain efficiency.

Optimize Product Mix : Review products like ClearWash Gel, which had high sales but relatively low profit margins. Consider price adjustments, bundling, or marketing strategies to improve profitability.
